## About The Project

This application was created to help myself with my macronutrient tracking, and also try out new recipes that are within my caloric budget.


https://github.com/yh13431/smartplate/assets/106964833/b7008d55-f5b9-4a0b-ba3e-1c844e486f39


Users must first log in with a Google Account, then they can interact with the web application.

The calculator page leverages the Nutritionix API to gather the macronutrient breakdown of the food item that the user inputs. The user can input both ingredients and actual meals, and if multiple foods are entered, the calculator will return their total breakdown.

The recommendation page recommends users 5 recipes from a list of over 20,000 recipes based on the users' desired calories, proteins, and fats intake. This was done using content-based filtering, where recipes are vectorised and compared using cosine similarity.

Users can then save these recipes for future use.
